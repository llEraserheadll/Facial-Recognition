# 😎 VisorAI – Emotion-Aware Facial Detection System

VisorAI is an intelligent facial detection system that identifies human emotions in real-time using computer vision and deep learning. It leverages powerful facial analysis models to interpret expressions such as happiness, sadness, anger, and more — giving your applications the ability to "read faces."

## 🚀 Features

- 🔍 Real-time facial detection via webcam
- 😃 Emotion recognition (Happy, Sad, Angry, Surprise, Neutral)
- 📊 Visual overlays for detected faces and expressions
- 📁 Modular notebook-based design for easy experimentation
- 💡 Clean and understandable code suitable for beginners and researchers alike

## 🛠 Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/VisorAI.git
   cd VisorAI
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the notebooks:
   - `Call.ipynb` - Main script for webcam-based emotion detection
   - `Codetest.ipynb` - Additional processing and testing utilities

---

## ▶️ Usage

Open `Call.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or VS Code and run the cells. It will access your webcam, detect faces, and classify emotions in real-time.

### Example Output

> When the webcam is active, you'll see bounding boxes around detected faces along with their corresponding emotions, like so:

```
😃 Person Detected – Emotion: Happy
😠 Person Detected – Emotion: Angry
```

## 🔬 Under the Hood

Here’s how VisorAI works under the hood:

### 1. **Face Detection**
- Utilizes OpenCV’s Haar cascades or DNN-based models to detect human faces from live webcam feed.
- Frames are processed in real time, and only relevant face regions are extracted for emotion classification.

### 2. **Preprocessing**
- Resizing and grayscale conversion are applied to facial crops.
- Faces are normalized to a fixed size (e.g., 48x48 or 64x64) expected by the model.

### 3. **Emotion Classification**
- A deep learning model (e.g., CNN trained on FER2013 dataset) is used to classify emotions.
- Softmax output returns probabilities for emotions like:
  - Happy
  - Sad
  - Angry
  - Surprise
  - Neutral

### 4. **Visualization**
- Detected emotions are overlaid on the video feed using OpenCV drawing functions.
- Real-time annotation enhances the interactive experience.

## 🔮 Future Work

Here are some exciting features and improvements planned for VisorAI:

### ✅ 1. **Emotion Logging and Analytics Dashboard**
- **Goal**: Store detected emotions over time for user analysis.
- **How**: Use a lightweight backend (e.g., SQLite or Firebase) to store timestamps and emotion data. Create a dashboard using `Dash` or `Streamlit`.

### ✅ 2. **Multi-face Tracking**
- **Goal**: Handle multiple people in the frame with consistent ID tracking.
- **How**: Integrate Deep SORT or face embeddings to assign consistent IDs to individuals across frames.

### ✅ 3. **Model Improvements**
- **Goal**: Improve emotion classification accuracy.
- **How**: Fine-tune state-of-the-art models like MobileNet or EfficientNet on larger, balanced datasets (e.g., AffectNet or RAF-DB).

### ✅ 4. **Browser-Based Version**
- **Goal**: Make VisorAI run in the browser using WebAssembly.
- **How**: Convert the emotion model to TensorFlow.js and use browser APIs for webcam access.

### ✅ 5. **Edge Device Deployment**
- **Goal**: Run VisorAI on Raspberry Pi or Jetson Nano.
- **How**: Optimize model using TensorRT or ONNX and redesign video pipeline for low-resource devices.
